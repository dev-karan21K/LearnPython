set:

union : union of two sets combines all the unique elements from both the sets

intersection : intersection of two sets contains only the elements that are common to both sets

difference : difference of two sets contains the elements that are in the first set but not in the second set


conditions and loops:

if elif else: conditional statements are used to make decisions in your program.

loop : loops are a way to repeat a block of code multiple times.

while loop : while loop executes the code as long as a condition is true / met
